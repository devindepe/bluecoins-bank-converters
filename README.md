# 🏦 Bluecoins Bank Importers

**Convert Ibercaja, BBVA & Revolut statements to Bluecoins CSV format**

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to convert bank statements (in Excel or CSV format) to the standard import format for the **Bluecoins** App. https://www.bluecoinsapp.com/import-guide/

The goal is to facilitate personal finance tracking without having to manually enter each transaction.

## 🚀 Installation and Requirements

To use these scripts, you need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.

1. **Download the project** and open a terminal in the repository folder.
2. **Install the required libraries**:

   - **On macOS / Linux:**
     ```bash
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## 🖥️ How to Use

The easiest way to convert your files is using the main launcher:

```bash
# On macOS / Linux
python3 main.py

# On Windows
python main.py
```

The script will automatically:
1. Ask you to select your bank.
2. Help you configure your account name and account type the first time (and save it for future use).
3. Open a file selector (or ask for the path) to process your bank statement.

The converted file will be generated in your configured output folder (or `/exports` by default) with the format `[bankname]_bluecoins_YYYYMMDD.csv` ready to import into Bluecoins.

## ⚙️ Configuration

On first run, the script will ask you to configure:

- **Account Name:** The exact name as it appears in your Bluecoins app (e.g., "Ibercaja Account")
- **Account Type:** The account category in Bluecoins (default: "Bank", but can be "Credit Card", "Cash", etc.)
- **Output Folder:** Where to save the generated CSV files
- **Output Name:** Base name for the generated files

These settings are saved in a `.env` file and reused in future runs. You can edit `.env` manually or delete it to reconfigure.

**Example `.env` file:**
```
OUTPUT_FOLDER=/Users/yourname/Documents/Bluecoins
ACCOUNT_NAME_IBERCAJA=Ibercaja Account
ACCOUNT_TYPE_IBERCAJA=Bank
OUTPUT_NAME_IBERCAJA=ibercaja_bluecoins
```

## 📥 Critical Configuration in Bluecoins

For your accounting to be accurate, follow these golden rules:

- **Initial Balance:** In Bluecoins, before importing anything, edit your account and set the "Initial Balance" manually. This should be the balance you had the day before the first transaction you're going to import. This prevents your balance from appearing negative.

- **Import:**
  - Open Bluecoins > Settings > Import data.
  - Choose the `.csv` file generated by the script.
  - The app will automatically map the columns thanks to the standard headers `(1)Type`, `(2)Date`, etc.

- **Avoid Duplicates:** The script doesn't detect if you've already imported a transaction previously. Make sure the Excel dates don't overlap with transactions you already have in the app.
