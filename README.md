# 🏦 Bluecoins Bank Importers

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to convert bank statements (in Excel or CSV format) to the standard import format for the **Bluecoins** App.

The goal is to facilitate personal finance tracking without having to manually enter each transaction.

## 🚀 Installation and Requirements

To use these scripts, you need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your computer.

1. **Download the project** and open a terminal in the repository folder.
2. **Install the required libraries**:

   - **On macOS / Linux:**
     ```bash
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## 🏦 Supported Banks and Instructions

### 1. Ibercaja (.xlsx)

The `ibercaja.py` script is optimized to process the official Excel file.

**How to download the file:**

- Log into your Ibercaja online banking.
- Go to **My Accounts > Transactions**.
- Select the dates you're interested in.
- Click the **Download** button and choose the Excel format (.xlsx).

> **Note:** Do not modify the file content before using the script.

**How to convert it:**

```bash
python ibercaja.py
```

The script will ask for the file path and generate a new file called `ibercaja_bluecoins.csv` ready to import.

**Account name customization:**

To have transactions automatically assigned to your account:

1. Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
2. Edit the `ACCOUNT_NAME_IBERCAJA` value with the exact name you use in Bluecoins.

### 2. BBVA

In development / Coming soon.

### 3. Revolut

In development / Coming soon.

## ⚙️ Critical Configuration in Bluecoins

For your accounting to be accurate, follow these golden rules:

- **Initial Balance:** In Bluecoins, before importing anything, edit your account and set the "Initial Balance" manually. This should be the balance you had the day before the first transaction you're going to import. This prevents your balance from appearing negative.

- **Import:**
  - Open Bluecoins > Settings > Import data.
  - Choose the `.csv` file generated by the script.
  - The app will automatically map the columns thanks to the standard headers `(1)Type`, `(2)Date`, etc.

- **Avoid Duplicates:** The script doesn't detect if you've already imported a transaction previously. Make sure the Excel dates don't overlap with transactions you already have in the app.
